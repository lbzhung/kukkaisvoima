Hello world

This is example entry. First line is always headline. Below the
headline html markup can be used for the actual blog entry.

* Like this
* And this

Remember to change the config variables in
kukkaisvoima_settings.py, otherwise links and comments wont work! The
most important variables are (you should use full URL for these):

*baseurl ='http://yourdomain/blog/index.cgi'*  
*stylesheet = 'kukka.css'*  
*feedicon = 'feed-icon-14x14.png'*  

Without changing those the CSS and feed icon image on the sidebar (<img alt="RSS Feed" src="feed-icon-14x14.png" style="vertical-align:top;
border:none;"/>) do not work properly.

Note also that kukkaisvoima_settings.py file contains sensitive
information and you should block all access to it from public web. For
example when using [Apache HTTP server]("http://httpd.apache.org/")
the following rule could be added to .htaccess file in the
Kukkaisvoima directory:

    <files kukkaisvoima_settings.py>
     order allow,deny
     deny from all
    </files>

Have fun!
